A kernel with comedi and VMK80xx modules must be used (Most recent kernels 3.X will 
have these by default).

To build/install on Debian based systems:
apt-get install libcomedi-dev libcomedi0
./make.sh
cd deb
./make_deb.sh
dpkg -i comedi-K8055-bash-interface

All program files are installed to /usr/local/bin

Run /usr/local/bin/k8055-help for descriptions of programs and usage.

Run programs as root.
